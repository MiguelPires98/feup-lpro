# Introduction
In this mini-quest, we were asked to portray the classical situation of "The Maze and The Dragon", which story follows:

# Game Rules
The user should be asked to enter single character commands in order to move the main character ("hero") in 4 possible directions (up, down, left, right). If there is a wall or door towards that direction, the hero remains at the same position. Upon entering each command, the program should update the game and reprint the game map. Hint: Use the Scanner class for input, as seen at the Tavern.

## Tasks II

*  "Refactoring" to Objects: Separate user interaction from game logic. Create two separate packages, one containing the class(es) for user input, for example: dkeep.cli (command line interface), and another containing the classes for the game logic, for example: dkeep.logic.

**Advanced Game Logic**

The key is randomly placed on the maze, when the game launches (on a valid position, without overlapping any of the other elements). Picking up the key does not "remotely" open the door. The Hero must reach the exit and spend one extra move (towards the exit cell) to unlock the door ('E' disappears) and only then can it move onto the exit and into freedom.

## The Story

**task I** 

*You awake still shattered from your last encounter...all is still fuzzy in your mind as you don't have any recollection on how you got to where you are...you can see a poorly-lite corridor and feel the damp smell of closed quarters. Where are your things? You are still dressed with your leather clothes, but no weapons or armour. Where are you? What dangers lie beyond?...A tinkle in the back of your head tells you that you must leave this place as fast as you can...*

**task II**

*The plot thickens...

*You just tapped your way through a damp corridor, following a draft until a sturdy shut door. The poorly lit doorway reveals a charred knob where a dim light protrudes through an obfuscated keyhole. You try to pry the door open, to no avail. There must be a way to unlock this door. You press onward along the faintly lit walkway, trying not to lose your bearings until heavy breathing halts you...Something or someone is alive in here...with you...the moment you take a turn, the sight before you has you gasping for air, as a surge of primal fear paralyses you...its...its a dragon. 

*Although snuggled and asleep, nothing would prepare you for such an encounter, as his scales sparkly reflect the dimness of the ambient light, revealing his imposing body, almost blocking the entire passage. But the crackly snap of hopelessness hits you when you spot another shiny object, hanging from his neck: a key. Surely, to the door. Undoubtedly, such an indomitable creature would not surrender his key on a mere request. Maybe you can snatch the key without waking the foul beast...

*But you need something to cut the necklace that holds the key...you carefully trace back your steps, and begin burrowing and scavenging throughout the passageways, trying to find something that might have been left behind by some other lost adventurer. Suddenly, you notice another dim sparkling light from a pile of rubble...as you move closer, you feel a foul stench of rotten and putrid flesh...amidst the rubble there is a corpse of a humanoid creature you cannot recognise. The smell is so bad, you barely dare to touch the remains, but the shiny light draws you to push the corpse aside...its...its....a sword!

*Praise the Gods! What a holy gift! Not even in your most wild expectations would you expect to find such a valuable item. The sword is sturdy, long and seems robust. Oddly enough it does not seem rusty at all...as if it had always been there for you to find it. Luckily, it appears to be quite sharp...cutting that key off the dragon should be sweet...Hopeful, you hustle back to where the dragon was, careful enough not to reveal your presence, and take a careful look over the corner at the sleeping....wait...where is he??!... Oh no!! ITS AWAKE!!!...*
